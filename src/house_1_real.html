			<p class="g-pstyle3">Internal documents disclose previously unknown details about the negotiations between Columbia University Apartheid Divest organizers and University administrators. Trustees played a large role in negotiations, and several deans and the chair of the University Senate executive committee served as liaisons between students and administrators. Documents show that Columbia was prepared to make several concessions to comply with protesters&rsquo; requests, but that CUAD&rsquo;s negotiators wanted more than what the University was willing to offer. </p>

			<p class="g-pstyle3">Correspondence between then-University President Minouche Shafik and members of Columbia&rsquo;s board of trustees show that trustees had reservations about cooperating with House Republicans&rsquo; investigations. Board of trustees co-chair Claire Shipman, CC &rsquo;86, SIPA &rsquo;94, described the congressional investigation as &ldquo;capital hill nonsense.&rdquo; Several trustees wrote that they hoped Democrats would win control of the House in the 2024 election under the assumption that congressional scrutiny would ease. Shafik wrote that she met with Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, who advised her that Columbia&rsquo;s &ldquo;political problems are really only among Republicans.&rdquo; </p>

			<p class="g-pstyle3">Internal communications reveal that top administrators and trustees had concerns about biases among members of the University Senate. One trustee referred to the &ldquo;antisemites on the Senate&rdquo; and suggested that the trustees should hold a vote of no confidence in the Senate. Journalism School Dean Jelani Cobb and Columbia College Dean Josef Sorett also expressed concerns about the body. &ldquo;Senate sounds like CUAD,&rdquo; Sorett wrote in one text message. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a spinoff,&rdquo; Cobb replied. </p>

			<p class="g-pstyle3">The appendices of the report contain dozens of pages detailing hundreds of disciplinary proceedings at Columbia and Barnard after Oct. 7, 2023, including some related to protest activity and others not related to demonstrations. The records show that, despite publicly committing to suspending or expelling students who violated University policy, Columbia was much more lenient in implementing sanctions. </p>

A Barnard spokesperson also confirmed that the college did not consent to the publication of the materials.</p>

			<p class="g-pstyle5">Shafik had written publicly that &ldquo;While the University will not divest from Israel, the University offered to develop an expedited timeline for review of new proposals from the students by the Advisory Committee for Socially Responsible Investing.&rdquo; The documents included in the report reveal that the University was considering a timeline of six months for reviewing proposals of divesting from specific companies tied to Israel or the manufacturing of weapons. </p>

			<p class="g-pstyle5">In her April 29 communication, Shafik wrote that the University offered to &ldquo;begin a discussion on access and financial barriers to academic programs and global centers.&rdquo; This document reveals that the University considered discussing access to the Tel Aviv University dual degree program and the Tel Aviv Global Center with the Israeli government. It also disclosed that the University was looking to partner with two universities: Al Quds University, located in the West Bank, and Haifa University, located in northwest Israel. </p>

			<p class="g-pstyle5">The &ldquo;menu&rdquo; of options shows that the University considered outlining a process for reinstating Columbia&rsquo;s chapters of Students for Justice in Palestine and Jewish Voice for Peace. Then-Senior Executive Vice President Gerald Rosberg said that the policies that Columbia cited in SJP and JVP&rsquo;s suspensions were altered without University Senate input weeks prior to the groups&rsquo; suspensions. At a Nov. 17, 2023 University Senate plenary, Rosberg committed to reexamining the policies and said, &ldquo;I know I am going to be living with this for a long time to come.&rdquo;</p>

			<p class="g-pstyle5">New documents reveal the specific details of the investments that Columbia offered to make. In September, interim University President Katrina Armstrong announced that Columbia was establishing a &ldquo;University International Student Hardship Fund,&rdquo; through which students from regions experiencing &ldquo;natural disasters, armed conflict, humanitarian crises, and other circumstances&rdquo; can apply for grants. </p>

		<div id="g-ai0-36" class="g-Layer_1 g-aiAbs" style="top:65.1691%;right:5.033%;width:87%;">
			<p class="g-pstyle6">The report&rsquo;s appendix includes the draft of a statement written by student organizers that they wanted Shafik to send to the Columbia community. The draft statement describes the war in Gaza as &ldquo;plausibly a genocide&rdquo; and states that &ldquo;Palestinians are surviving a myriad of other injustices.&rdquo; It continues to call the University&rsquo;s disciplinary processes &ldquo;overly punitive and viewpoint discriminatory.&rdquo; The draft email also says that NYPD presence on campus &ldquo;has contributed to a sense of danger&rdquo; and describes a &ldquo;McCarthyist censorship of our faculty.&rdquo; </p>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<p class="g-pstyle6">The appendix includes emails between then-Executive Vice President for Public Affairs Shailagh Murray and Shafik in response to the draft statement. Shafik replied to an email with the draft statement attached, calling it &ldquo;unacceptable.&rdquo; Murray responded that she was &ldquo;really uncomfortable giving them sign off on anything from you&rdquo; and that &ldquo;It&rsquo;s too easy a target if they are looking for an excuse to blow this up.&rdquo;</p>

			<p class="g-pstyle5">Shafik had written publicly that &ldquo;While the University will not divest from Israel, the University offered to develop an expedited timeline for review of new proposals from the students by the Advisory Committee for Socially Responsible Investing.&rdquo; The documents included in the report reveal that the University was considering a timeline of six months for reviewing proposals of divesting from specific companies tied to Israel or the manufacturing of weapons. </p>

			<p class="g-pstyle5">In her April 29 communication, Shafik wrote that the University offered to &ldquo;begin a discussion on access and financial barriers to academic programs and global centers.&rdquo; This document reveals that the University considered discussing access to the Tel Aviv University dual degree program and the Tel Aviv Global Center with the Israeli government. It also disclosed that the University was looking to partner with two universities: Al Quds University, located in the West Bank, and Haifa University, located in northwest Israel. </p>

			<p class="g-pstyle5">The University considered offering amnesty for students who participated in the first &ldquo;Gaza Solidarity Encampment&rdquo; on April 18 and had no prior offenses.

			<p class="g-pstyle5">The &ldquo;menu&rdquo; of options shows that the University considered outlining a process for reinstating Columbia&rsquo;s chapters of Students for Justice in Palestine and Jewish Voice for Peace. Then-Senior Executive Vice President Gerald Rosberg said that the policies that Columbia cited in SJP and JVP&rsquo;s suspensions were altered without University Senate input weeks prior to the groups&rsquo; suspensions. At a Nov. 17, 2023 University Senate plenary, Rosberg committed to reexamining the policies and said, &ldquo;I know I am going to be living with this for a long time to come.&rdquo;</p>

			<p class="g-pstyle5">New documents reveal the specific details of the investments that Columbia offered to make.

		<div id="g-ai2-36" class="g-Layer_1 g-aiAbs" style="top:64.8206%;right:4.7587%;width:87%;">
			<p class="g-pstyle6">The report&rsquo;s appendix includes the draft of a statement written by student organizers that they wanted Shafik to send to the Columbia community. The draft statement describes the war in Gaza as &ldquo;plausibly a genocide&rdquo; and states that &ldquo;Palestinians are surviving a myriad of other injustices.&rdquo; It continues to call the University&rsquo;s disciplinary processes &ldquo;overly punitive and viewpoint discriminatory.&rdquo; The draft email also says that NYPD presence on campus &ldquo;has contributed to a sense of danger&rdquo; and describes a &ldquo;McCarthyist censorship of our faculty.&rdquo; </p>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<p class="g-pstyle6">The appendix includes emails between then-Executive Vice President for Public Affairs Shailagh Murray and Shafik in response to the draft statement. Shafik replied to an email with the draft statement attached, calling it &ldquo;unacceptable.&rdquo; Murray responded that she was &ldquo;really uncomfortable giving them sign off on anything from you&rdquo; and that &ldquo;It&rsquo;s too easy a target if they are looking for an excuse to blow this up.&rdquo;</p>
