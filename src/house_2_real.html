			<p class="g-pstyle0">While Shafik told one student that she did not agree with calls &ldquo;for the removal of Zionists from campus,&rdquo; she did not issue a Universitywide statement in support of the program. Last spring, students in Columbia College and Barnard passed referendums through their school councils to cancel the dual degree program. Students in the School of Engineering and Applied Science also voted in favor of ending the dual degree program in a survey sent out by the Engineering Student Council this fall.</p>

			<p class="g-pstyle0">After learning of the Columbia College Student Council&rsquo;s referendum on canceling the dual degree program, General Studies Dean Lisa Rosen-Metsch wrote an April 12 email to Shafik asking her to consider issuing a public statement in support of the program. Cohen sent an email the same day expressing a similar sentiment.</p>

Chief Operating Officer Cas Holloway replied that he agreed that Shafik should release a statement in support of the dual degree program and its students. &ldquo;This isn&rsquo;t about Brian,&rdquo; he wrote. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s just wrong.&rdquo; </p>

			<p class="g-pstyle0">On April 30, then-University spokesperson Ben Chang wrote that all students occupying Hamilton had created an &ldquo;untenable situation&rdquo; and would &ldquo;face expulsion.&rdquo; He added that all students who chose to remain in the &ldquo;Gaza Solidarity Encampment&rdquo; would face interim suspension. Of the 22 students who were arrested for occupying Hamilton, none were permanently expelled. </p>

			<p class="g-pstyle0">In April, Columbia College student Khymani James issued an apology via a CUAD Instagram post for saying &ldquo;Zionists Don&rsquo;t Deserve to Live&rdquo; in a resurfaced video from January. They were then banned from the Morningside campus. In October, James filed a discrimination lawsuit against Columbia. CUAD subsequently retracted the April apology post and issued an apology to James in an Instagram post on Oct. 8. Following the retraction, a group of 25 attorneys general sent a letter to Armstrong citing James&rsquo; comment as an example of &ldquo;antisemitic rhetoric.&rdquo; </p>

		<div id="g-ai0-9" class="g-Layer_1 g-aiAbs" style="top:48.2989%;right:3.8237%;width:26.3333%;">
			<p class="g-pstyle0">On April 4, six students were suspended and evicted from University housing for their alleged involvement in a &ldquo;Resistance 101&rdquo; panel, which featured speakers with alleged ties to U.S.-designated terrorist organizations. On April 5, Shafik wrote in a press release that &ldquo;a number of students&rdquo; had been suspended for alleged involvement in the panel. She also confirmed that law enforcement was notified and the University &ldquo;hired an outside investigation firm to uncover all the facts.&rdquo; The report states that none of the five identified students received suspensions, with two receiving conditional disciplinary probation and three receiving disciplinary warnings.</p>
		</div>
		<div id="g-ai0-10" class="g-Layer_1 g-aiAbs" style="top:54.4662%;right:3.8237%;width:26.3333%;">
			<p class="g-pstyle0">The NYPD arrested three protesters at an &ldquo;All Out for Palestine&rdquo; protest outside the 116th Street and Broadway gates in February. Spectator reported that officers pinned multiple protestors to the ground, slammed a man into a parked car, and punched a woman in the stomach, according to interviews with protesters and several videos that circulated on social media. One of the individuals arrested was a 31-year-old General Studies student. An NYPD spokesperson told Spectator that they were arrested on suspicion of grand larceny for grabbing an officer&rsquo;s hat and throwing it on the ground.</p>
		</div>
		<div id="g-ai0-11" class="g-Layer_1 g-aiAbs" style="top:60.773%;right:3.8237%;width:26.3333%;">
			<p class="g-pstyle0">The report describes disciplinary action taken against one student who &ldquo;repeatedly harassed&rdquo; others. In one instance, a Columbia student shouted &ldquo;Fuck the Jews&rdquo; at least three separate times. The student initially received an interim suspension, but it was later downgraded to a one-year disciplinary probation. </p>
		</div>
		<div id="g-ai0-12" class="g-Layer_1 g-aiAbs" style="top:68.8291%;right:3.9096%;width:26.3333%;">
			<p class="g-pstyle0">Over the course of the &ldquo;Gaza Solidarity Encampment,&rdquo; Barnard issued interim suspensions to 55 students. Seniors were the largest portion of the affected students. Unlike suspended Columbia students, all suspended Barnard students were evicted from their campus housing. </p>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<p class="g-pstyle0">The &ldquo;alternative resolution&rdquo; amnesty process was offered to students who had no prior conduct matters. Under the process, students had to accept responsibility for misconduct, were issued a written warning, were placed on probation until August 9, and had to write a 100-word reflection paper. </p>
		</div>
		<div id="g-ai0-13" class="g-Layer_1 g-aiAbs" style="top:74.857%;right:3.9096%;width:26.3333%;">
			<p class="g-pstyle0">The student referenced placed a Palestinian flag on Alma Mater. On top of a two-years probation and a required reflection paper, the student was issued 50 hours of community service. This is the only instance in the entire report of a student being reprimanded with community service hours. </p>
		</div>
		<div id="g-ai0-14" class="g-Layer_1 g-aiAbs" style="top:79.7756%;right:3.9096%;width:26.3333%;">
			<p class="g-pstyle0"> In this section, the report argues that the University Senate has been composed of members who were sympathetic to the encampment and opposed discipline for the protesters. </p>

			<p class="g-pstyle0">CSSI refers to the Center for Student Success and Intervention, an administrative unit established in 2022. It consists of three subdivisions: student conduct, case management, and a student support specialist. Transferring the cases from CSSI to the University Judicial Board, a five-member body separate from the senate&rsquo;s Rules of University Conduct committee, implements the &ldquo;Rules process&rdquo; as the procedure for each case. Unlike the CSSI process, the Rules process grants students the right to an attorney and the ability to call witnesses and advisors to assist with their case. </p>
		</div>
		<div id="g-ai0-16" class="g-Layer_1 g-aiAbs" style="top:96.1478%;right:3.9096%;width:26.3333%;">
			<p class="g-pstyle0">The report argues that administrative oversight of the Rules process was biased due to some faculty members on the Rules of University Conduct committee having expressed support for the encampment and related pro-Palestinian activism. The committee reviews and revises the Rules, whereas the University Judicial Board adjudicates Rules violations. </p>
