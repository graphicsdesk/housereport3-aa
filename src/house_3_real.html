			<p class="g-pstyle0"> According to the report, the conversation between Shafik, Shipman, and Greenwald demonstrates a &ldquo;substantial weakening&rdquo; of the administration&rsquo;s position on student discipline. Shafik suggested using the more restrictive CSSI process for seven &ldquo;repeat offenders,&rdquo; and disciplining those who occupied Hamilton through the UJB procedure. Shipman and Greenwald warned that this would not meet the expectations of the board of trustees. </p>

			<p class="g-pstyle0"> Jonathan Lavine, chair emeritus of the board of trustees, suggested that the trustees take a vote of no confidence on senate and faculty leadership. The report suggests that this is a culmination of &ldquo;shock and disdain&rdquo; for the University Senate&rsquo;s &ldquo;radicalism.&rdquo; </p>

			<p class="g-pstyle0">Michael Nutter is the David N. Dinkins professor of professional practice in urban and public affairs. According to Shipman, Nutter described the conversations in University Senate plenaries as indicative of a &ldquo;big political crisis.&rdquo; Their conversations lead into how to &ldquo;activate other faculty&rdquo; that are, according to Nutter, less &ldquo;nuts.&rdquo;</p>

			<p class="g-pstyle0">The report puts considerable emphasis on Jeanine D&rsquo;Armiento, chair of the executive committee of the University Senate, labeling her actions as &ldquo;hypocritical&rdquo; of a &ldquo;purported commitment to freedom of expression.&rdquo; D&rsquo;Armiento served as a key liaison between student negotiators and administrators during the &ldquo;Gaza Solidarity Encampment.&rdquo; In October, a petition circulated expressing concerns that the University Senate might reelect D&rsquo;Armiento to a fourth term as executive committee chair.  </p>

			<p class="g-pstyle0">Shafik was invited to testify before the Committee, chaired by Virginia Foxx (R-NC), on Dec. 5, 2023, but could not attend due to a scheduling conflict. The article Shipman refers to was written by New York Times reporter Sharon Otterman and detailed how Shafik avoided media backlash by not attending the hearing. Later, Shafik was invited to testify in front of the same committee alongside Shipman, Greenwald, and Schizer. </p>

			<p class="g-pstyle0"> The report argues that both Shafik&rsquo;s communication with Schumer along with Lavine&rsquo;s message about the upcoming midterm elections indicated that University administrators saw the hearing as partisan and &ldquo;hoped to escape accountability.&rdquo; </p>
