  The House Committee on Education and the Workforce published a <a href="https://edworkforce.house.gov/uploadedfiles/10.30.24_committee_on_education_and_the_workforce_republican_staff_report_-_antisemitism_on_college_campuses_exposed.pdf">325-page report</a> on antisemitism on college campuses on Oct. 31, the culmination of over 11 months of scrutiny of 11 universities. The Republican-led committee used its subpoena powers over two universities—Columbia and Harvard—for the first time in its history.

            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  Over 143 pages—nearly half of the report—centers on the committee’s investigation into Columbia and Barnard, publishing information from the over 50,000 pages of confidential documents that the University submitted following the August subpoena. Columbia was the only university to be referenced in each of the report’s four key conclusions.

It consists of three subdivisions: student conduct, case management, and a student support specialist. Transferring the cases from CSSI to the University Judicial Board, a five-member body separate from the senate&rsquo;s Rules of University Conduct committee, implements the &ldquo;Rules process&rdquo; as the procedure for each case. Unlike the CSSI process, the Rules process grants students the right to an attorney and the ability to call witnesses and advisors to assist with their case. </p>
